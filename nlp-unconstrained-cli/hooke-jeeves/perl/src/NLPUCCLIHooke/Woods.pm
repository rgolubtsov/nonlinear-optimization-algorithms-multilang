=head1 NAME

NLPUCCLIHooke::Woods - The Hooke-Jeeves nonlinear minimization algorithm
in application to the Woods test problem

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Woods> class is responsible for solving a nonlinear optimization problem
using the algorithm of Hooke and Jeeves (Woods test problem).

The objective function in this case is the so-called I<Woods> function.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 RHO_WOODS

Constant. The stepsize geometric shrink.

 The Hooke & Jeeves algorithm works reasonably well on Rosenbrock's
 function, but can fare worse on some standard test functions,
 depending on rho. Here is an example that works well when rho = 0.5,
 but fares poorly with rho = 0.6, and better again with rho = 0.8.

use constant RHO_WOODS => 0.6;

=head1 METHODS

=head2 f

The user-supplied objective function f(x,n).

Woods -- a la More, Garbow & Hillstrom (TOMS algorithm 566).

 @param   {Number[]} x - The point at which f(x) should be evaluated.
 @param   {Number}   n - The number of coordinates of x.

 @returns {Number}       The objective function value.

    $s3 = $x->[INDEX_ONE]   - 1;

    $t1 = $x->[INDEX_THREE] - $x->[INDEX_TWO]  * $x->[INDEX_TWO];
    $t2 = 1                 - $x->[INDEX_TWO];
    $t3 = $x->[INDEX_THREE] - 1;

    $t4 = $s3 + $t3;
